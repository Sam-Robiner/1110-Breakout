# 1110-Breakout
Final project for CS 1110 - Breakout game

BASIC GAME DESCRIPTION:
Breakout brick-and-ball game, can be played in GUI from command line. Ball bounces off of paddle, controlled by arrow keys,
and hits bricks to eliminate the brick and give the player a certain number of points, depending on which row the brick is in. 
The player loses points every time the ball hits the paddle, so try to make your hits count!

The player has 3 lives per game. A life is lost when the player misses the ball with the paddle. A player wins when all the bricks
are eliminated.

EXTRA FEATURES DESCRIPTION:
The angle of the ball bouncing off the paddle depends on where the ball hits on the paddle.

Occasionally, small red boxes containing a certain number of points is dropped from a brick when it is hit by the ball. Get these
points by catching the box with the paddle. The number of points in the box increases for bricks in higher rows, but they will also
drop faster!

The ball speeds up over time, making it harder for the player to survive. When the player loses a new life, the speed of the ball
 resets to its original slower speed.
